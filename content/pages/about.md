# This human

Hello outsider.

I’m Ricardo López Cabañero, an Industrial Design Engineer mostly focused on 3D digital and interactive works.

More about my 3D professional portfolio [here](http://rirsc.xyz).

My main interests are music ([gigs](https://www.notion.so/Web-2-0-Gigs-bc40454f5f0743b0a9d37f6144834c5a?pvs=21)), [boardgames](https://www.notion.so/Web-2-0-Boardgames-d5ee67fee6774c9ab560fa8aa550bb67?pvs=21) and rolegames, comix, design, films, riding my bike around forests and playing with computers to create stuff.

# This website

This site is a digital sandbox. My [‘memex’](https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/). 

Just an excuse to return to my first approach to computers when I was a teen; building sites to have fun with my friends. An overall excuse to get more into coding and writing as well as placing all my discoveries and log my projects.

Its also an excuse to force me to write more english. Please keep that in mind when you find the inmense amount of grammas errors that will spread the site.

Static website etc

No trackers, no ads. Privacy policy: not collecting or retaining any data at all.

## Important info

> I want my webpage to be static, minimalist, energy-efficient and fast.
> 
- This website has no tracking or analytics.
- Based on [Humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/), it has, of course, its own humans.txt
- No JavaScript
- [Designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) - Although I need to add a rule to show when a link is pointing outside of this site…
- [Manual until it hurts](https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts)
- It’s aiming to be part of the [less than 1MB club](https://1mb.club/blog/https-redirects/)
- Permacomputing, frugal computing, Solarpunk, artisan engineering…
    - I am already aware of the amount of work I still have to put in here to achieve a better a more lightweight site. I will do my best.

## Dogmas

- [RSS Clubs is cool](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/)
- This [handmade](https://gossipsweb.net/) club is cool too
- [Manifest for a Humane Web](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/)
- [Digital Ecology](https://adasokol.com/digital-ecology/)
- The [Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) is the Best Web
- [This interview is just perfect.](https://www.kickscondor.com/nadia-eghbal/)

Anyhow, have fun. My goal is also to infest you with the idea of creating a static website. The internet is getting a bit boring lately, and there is also this [Dead Internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), which I just hope is wrong because it sounds terribly sad.

I cant encourage you enough to start your own site now!

There are plenty of options out there, my setup is just using Hugo with the awesome theme Ficurina and deploying everything at Github.

For something like that, these tutorials are cool:

- [How to Build a Personal Website Using GitHub Pages and Hugo?](https://juliecodestack.github.io/2023/04/13/build_hugo_site/)
- [Host on Github Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

And it was running within minutes :) If you are struggling with it, feel free to reach me. I am not an expert but I could try my best to help you. Apart from Hugo, I also tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) before.

# Inspirational sites

This site is a compendium of places which we could agree are considered diy places and therefore interesting. Probably at the top of my influences we could have:

[100r](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html)

[Wnadiarwb](https://wnoadiarwb.us/)

[Gwern](https://gwern.net/index)

[Rat Factor](https://ratfactor.com/)

[Kicks Condor](https://www.kickscondor.com/)

[javier.computer](https://javier.computer/)

If you need even more rabbit holes, I have collected more awesome sites in [here.](https://www.notion.so/Web-2-0-Digital-Love-3b4bff5b575244a1894eed38ea2365b2?pvs=21) Heat up some coffe, put some nice music and get ready for the trip.
