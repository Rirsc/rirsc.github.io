Hello outsider.\
I’m Ricardo, an Industrial Design Engineer mostly focused on 3D digital and interactive works. I love playing with technology and my main interests are [music,](/pages/etc/gigs/) [games](/pages/etc/games/) comix, design, films, riding my bike around forests and playing with computers to create stuff.

A more precise portfolio focused on my 3D professional job is found at [rirsc.xyz](http://rirsc.xyz) but I plan to move everything to this site sooner or later.

## This website

This site is a digital sandbox.\
Sometimes a blog, sometimes a wiki, maybe a [‘memex’](https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/) but everytime is messy.
[Advanced hypertexting](https://www.kickscondor.com/hypertexting/), I guess.  Many pages are in progress, or incorrect. This is my tiny realm and its fine that way. 

> I want my webpage to be static, minimalist, energy-efficient and fast.
- This website has no tracking, analytics or ads.
- It has its own [humans.txt](/humans.txt) as following this [cute idea](https://humanstxt.org/)
- No JavaScript.
- [Designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- [Manual until it hurts](https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts)
- It’s aiming to be part of the [less than 1MB club](https://1mb.club/blog/https-redirects/)
- Still far from but with the following terms in mind: [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/permacomputing/), [frugal computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06642),  [solarpunk](https://adasokol.com/on-the-solar-adaptations/)

**Dogmas**

- The [Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) is the best web.

## Colophon

Have fun. My goal is to infest you with the idea of creating a static website. The internet is getting a bit boring lately, and there is also this [Dead Internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), which I just hope is wrong because it sounds terribly sad.

I cant encourage you enough to start your own site now. We all should be dead bored by now of looking at the same grids and feeds. Just jump in and start polinating whatever you have in mind.

There are plenty of options out there, my setup is basically using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the awesome theme [Ficurina](https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia) and deploying everything at Github.

For something like that, these tutorials are cool:

- [How to Build a Personal Website Using Hugo](https://juliecodestack.github.io/2023/04/13/build_hugo_site/)
- [Host on Github Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

And it was running within minutes :) If you are struggling with it, feel free to reach me. I am not an expert but I could try my best to help you. Apart from Hugo, I also tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) before.

## Inspirational sites

This site is a compendium of places which we could agree are considered diy places and therefore interesting. Probably at the top of my influences, we could have:

[100r](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html)\
[wnoadiarwb](https://wnoadiarwb.us/)\
[gwern](https://gwern.net/index)\
[ratfactor](https://ratfactor.com/)\
[kickscondor](https://www.kickscondor.com/)\
[javier.computer](https://javier.computer/)

If you need even more rabbit holes, I have collected more awesome sites in my [digital love.](/pages/etc/digital-love/) Heat up some coffee, put some nice music, and get ready for the trip.
