Hello world! This is usually how I start my websites.

Anyway, let's keep this quick and simple, my name is Gabriele Musco, as you can probably tell by the name of the website, and I'm a developer.

I also have a YouTube channel called [Tech Pills](https://techpills.technology) where I talk about tech, Linux and other related stuff I like.

This blog is about me and what I'm working on, and what I feel like talking about.
