Ey there stranger. Ricardo here, **welcome to my abode :)**

I’m an industrial design engineer with a focus on 3D digital and interactive works. Passionate about blending aesthetics and functionality, my projects range from 3D animation to interactive installations and coding. Currently, I’m contributing to **spatial computing prototypes at Magic Leap,** shaping immersive experiences at the forefront of XR technology.

**Beyond work,** I find joy in  [music,](/pages/etc/gigs/) boardgames&rolegames, comix, design, films and riding my bike around forests. Playing with technology and exploring creative ideas keeps me inspired and always ready for new ways to expand my knowledge.

## About this site

### Key points

This site is my **digital sandbox** where I intend to document my activities and online discoveries. A so-called [memex](https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/) an archive of my experiences and acquired knowledge.

Sometimes a blog, sometimes a wiki, maybe a [‘memex’](https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/) but everytime is messy.
[Advanced hypertexting](https://www.kickscondor.com/hypertexting/) I guess. Many pages are in progress, or incorrect. **This is my tiny realm and its fine that way.**

> Similarly, without an open, unified network, the whole notion of business online would have been entirely feudal from the start. Instead, it only took a feudal turn around the turn of the century. These days, instead of websites on the open Internet, people are more likely to create apps in proprietary stores or profiles on proprietary social media sites.

### Dogmas

- This website has no tracking, analytics or ads.
- It has its own [humans.txt](/humans.txt) as following this [cute idea](https://humanstxt.org/)
- [Designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- [Manual until it hurts](https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts)
- It’s aiming to be part of the [less than 1MB club](https://1mb.club/blog/https-redirects/)
- Still far from but with the following in mind: [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/permacomputing/) [frugal computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06642) [solarpunk](https://adasokol.com/on-the-solar-adaptations/)
- The [Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/) is the best web.
- [Digital Ecology](https://adasokol.com/digital-ecology/)
- [Websites must be accesible](https://normadesign.it/en/log/web-design-origin-of-the-web/)
- I want my webpage to be static, minimalist, energy-efficient and fast.

### Inspirational sites

This site is a compendium of places which we could agree are considered **diy places and therefore interesting.** Probably at the top of my influences, we could have:

[100r](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html)\
[wnoadiarwb](https://wnoadiarwb.us/)\
[gwern](https://gwern.net/index)\
[ratfactor](https://ratfactor.com/)\
[kickscondor](https://www.kickscondor.com/)\
[javier.computer](https://javier.computer/)

If you need even more rabbit holes, I have collected more awesome sites in my [digital love.](/pages/etc/digital-love/) Heat up some coffee, put some nice music, and get ready for the trip.

### Colophon

Have fun. My goal is to infest you with the idea of creating a static website. The internet is getting a bit boring lately, and there is also this [Dead Internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) which I just hope is wrong because it sounds terribly sad.

I cant encourage you enough to **start your own site now.** We all should be dead bored by now of looking at the same grids and feeds. Just jump in and start polinating whatever you have in mind.

There are plenty of options out there, my setup is basically using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the awesome theme [Ficurina](https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia) and deploying everything at Github.

For something like that, these tutorials are cool:

- [How to Build a Personal Website Using Hugo](https://juliecodestack.github.io/2023/04/13/build_hugo_site/)
- [Host on Github Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

And it was running within minutes :) If you are struggling with it, feel free to reach me. I am not an expert but I could try my best to help you. Apart from Hugo, I also tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) before.
