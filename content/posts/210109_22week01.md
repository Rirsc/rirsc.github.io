I discovered and read about the [Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox) It put words into something that I learn while studiying character animation; basic human locomotive is extremely expensive and difficult to compute. I still dont get why we are triying to replicate our movements and lookalikes.

Just fall in love with John Wilson again as Im going trought the second season of his masterpiece ‘How to with John Wilson’. For the ones that want to deep diver into his work, his [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/johnsmovies) is full of similar videos with the same approach to life.

Catching up with [Forming](https://jessemoynihan.com/) by Jesse Moynihan. I cant wait to be finished and collected in a sweet printed edition. I mean, reading it on a screen is ok, but cant compete with a proper edition of it to grab whenever I need to be amazed with its colors, characters and story overall.
