I discovered and read about the [Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox) It put words into something that I learn while studiying character animation; basic human locomotive is extremely expensive and difficult to compute. I still dont get why we are triying to replicate our movements and lookalikes.

Just fall in love with **John Wilson** again as Im going trought the second season of his masterpiece ‘How to with John Wilson’. Btw, apart from his [official vimeo](https://vimeo.com/johnsmovies) he also has this other account with even more content in case you need it: [DATES](https://vimeo.com/datejohn)

Catching up with [Forming](https://jessemoynihan.com/) by **Jesse Moynihan**. I cant wait to be finished and collected in a sweet printed edition. I mean, reading it on a screen is ok, but cant compete with a proper edition of it to grab whenever I need to be amazed with its colors, characters and story overall.
