I discovered [Flaaryr](https://flaaryr.bandcamp.com/) and his previous band, [Hungría](https://hungria.bandcamp.com/album/cumbre-de-nieves-perpetuas) His setup is quite nice, make sure to check his social media for a deeper look at the equipment he has to achieve the alien noises he creates.

On Friday we went to SO36 and saw Die Vierlierer, which was quite cool and crowded. The djs afterwards, a couple throwing german 80s postpunk awesonenes were incredibly good.
