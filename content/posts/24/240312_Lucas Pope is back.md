![Mars After Midnight](/images/posts/mars-after-midnight.webp)

[Return of the Obra Dinn](https://obradinn.com/) is probably one of the best experiences I had ever have playing a videogame. The art style, the hard puzzles and all the secrets that the history hides. It was also nice cos I played this solo game with friends, so the experience was even cooler. **Nothing better than struggling with other brains.**

Anyway, I wrote this post to mention the new game from [Lucas Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pope) the creator of the Obra. Its called [Mars After Midnight](https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/) I dont own a [Playdate](https://play.date/) so I wont be able to play it. But the art looks awesome and the approach sounds *(too)* similar to another of his gems; [Papers Please](https://papersplea.se/)
