**Hack&Tell #100** at [C-Base](https://c-base.org/) Its cool because its as informal as the past editions, just slighty longer due to some delay in the pause. They are doing some printings to whoever brings a t-shirt, so its totally understandable. At the beginning there is also a nice recap with photos from the very early editions, and some memorables moments that are shared from fixed attendes. The project that won is [QR-DICE: 6-side QR-cube](https://medium.com/altsoph/qr-dice-6-sided-qr-cube-c21be8f0ca11) and it just blown our minds.

The algo did its job cos I recently finished [Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will by Robert Sapolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determined:_A_Science_of_Life_Without_Free_Will) and this conversation about free will between Robert and his love-hate nemesis, Daniel Dennet, appeared on my feed. Watch it [here](https://youtu.be/aYzFH8xqhns?si=AyH4eAHs5cot8JYk)

Terrible weather and even worse politicians have devastated part of *Comunitat Valenciana.* All my love to the marvelous people that live in that beautiful part of the world. ♡
