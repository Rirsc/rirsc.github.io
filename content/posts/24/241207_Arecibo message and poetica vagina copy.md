We went to see Beethoven 7 by Sasha Waltz & Guests at the magnificent Radial System.

Divided into two parts, the first was Freiheit/Extasis, a sci-fi trip that filled the entire space with smoke and dancers wearing futuristic, martian-like costumes. The music was performed live by Diego Noguera.

Afterward it was 7. Sinfonie in A by Ludwig van Beethoven. Such cool movements and an incredible overall performance. Damn, in the middle of it, one of the dancers was raising a silk flag with the most iridescent colors I have ever seen live.

At the end, they displayed a banner protesting the recent budget cuts for culture in Berlin.
