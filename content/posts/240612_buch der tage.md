By chance, I discovered the bookshop *langer blomqvist*, which is full of discounted and second-hand books. I bought the gem *Buch der Tage*, by Patti Smith. It consists of a daily photo with a small description covering 2018.

Its in German, so I decided it could be cool to force me to read and translate the accordance day.
Today, 12 of June, says as follows: ‘Lighted candles in memory of the deceases at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Près´.
