By chance, I discovered the bookshop ‘langer blomqvist’, which is full of discounted and second-hand books. I bought this gem, ‘ Buch der Tage’, by Patti Smith. It consists of a daily photo with a small description covering 2018. Its in German, so I decided it could be cool to force me to read and translate the accordance day.

The one for 12 June says as follows: ‘Lighted candles in memory of the deceases at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Près´.
