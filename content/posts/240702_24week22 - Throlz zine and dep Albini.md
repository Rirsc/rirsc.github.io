After seeing [Trholz](https://trholzriot.bandcamp.com/album/premi-re-pierre) at idvdogh, I bought them one **fanzine.** Cool drawings and it has the lyrics&tabs of the songs; win-win.

I have been playing the latest album from **Shellac, To All Trains** (snif, DEP Steve Albini) in order to keep his memory a bit more recent in my brain these days. Im also thinking on re-doing again his famous [‘Fluffy’](https://www.mashed.com/1580426/fluffy-coffee-steve-albini-drank-studio/) coffe.

This is an authentic gem: [A curated collection of HCI demo videos produced during the golden age from 1983-2002](https://jackrusher.com/classic-ux/)

Re-watching **Serial Experiments Lain,** because its so on point with how we communicate online and it doesnt matter when you read this.

**My favorite thing is Monsters II** is finally out. Time for a visit to the store :)

Lately I was digging back into math rock, so this session [Math rock NTS session](https://www.nts.live/shows/loraine-james/episodes/loraine-james-7th-july-2022) by Loraine James comes just perfect.

[TTRPGs for Palestine](https://itch.io/b/2295/ttrpgs-for-palestine) is a cute project with a tons of interesting TTRPGs. I think I dont know even one though, wow.

I bought the volumen II from [Web Wide World](https://johnpowell-jones.bandcamp.com/album/web-wide-world-game-ost) and I read it while listening to his OST. Go check [John Powell-Jones](https://www.johnpowell-jones.co.uk/) art.

Finished **Animal Well**; now the fun starts.
