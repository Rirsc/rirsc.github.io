In this house we adore anything that [Chris](https://www.instagram.com/uglystupidhonest/) makes. His approach to music is as clever and beautiful as the rest of his art. For his latest project he has built a music label, [spectral cartography](https://spectralcartography.bandcamp.com/album/15-40-relay-race?from=search&logged_in_menubar=true&search_item_id=1132279508&search_item_type=b&search_match_part=%3F&search_page_id=3726377253&search_page_no=0&search_rank=1) and it even have a couple of tracks mixed by Andi Toma, from the marvelous [Mouse on Mars](https://mouseonmars.bandcamp.com/?from=search&search_item_id=2381589351&search_item_type=b&search_match_part=%3F&search_page_id=3726385384&search_page_no=0&search_rank=1&logged_in_menubar=true)
