After seeing Throlz, I bought them the fanzine from the picture attached in this post. Cool drawings and it has the lyrics and tabs of the songs; win-win.

I have been playing the latest album from Shellac, To All Trains (snif, DEP Steve Albini) in order to keep his memory a bit more recent in my brain these days. Im also thinking on re-doing again his famous [‘Fluffy’](https://www.mashed.com/1580426/fluffy-coffee-steve-albini-drank-studio/) coffe.

This is an authentic gem: [A curated collection of HCI demo videos produced during the golden age from 1983-2002.](https://jackrusher.com/classic-ux/)

Re-watching Serial Experiments Lain, because its so on point and it doesnt matter when you read this.

My favorite thing is Monsters II is out! Time for a visit to the store :)

[Math rock NTS session](https://www.nts.live/shows/loraine-james/episodes/loraine-james-7th-july-2022) by the one and only Loraine James, yes!

[TTRPGs for Palestine.](https://itch.io/b/2295/ttrpgs-for-palestine) Cute but I think I dont know even one, wow.

I bought the volumen II from [Web Wide World](https://johnpowell-jones.bandcamp.com/album/web-wide-world-game-ost), and I read it while listening to the OST.
