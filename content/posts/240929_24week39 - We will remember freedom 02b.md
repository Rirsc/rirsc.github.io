These are definetly a worthy words put together by [Margaret Killjoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Killjoy) about one of the sweetest, charmest and most brillante humans we had have so far; Ursuka K. Le Guin. [We will remember freedom](https://blog.pmpress.org/2019/07/17/we-will-remember-freedom/)

On this new approach looking for a better web, [[matrix]](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/) cross my path. Im just leaving the link here for the future me to take a look at. I still need to study better the real differences from the protocols Activitypub (Mastodon) and Atproto (Bluesky).

After some time collecting and filtering throught some german youtube channels, I think [Maithink X](https://www.youtube.com/@maithinkx) is one of my fav so far.
