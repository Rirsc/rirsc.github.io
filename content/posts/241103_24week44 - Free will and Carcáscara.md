Hack&Tell #100 at the one and only C-Base. Its cool because its as informal as the past editions, just slighty longer due to some delay in the pause because they are doing some printings to whoever brings a t-shirt. At the beginning there is also a nice recap with photos from the very early editions, and some momentos memorables that are shared from fixed attendes. The project that won is [QR-DICE: 6-side QR-cube](https://medium.com/altsoph/qr-dice-6-sided-qr-cube-c21be8f0ca11) and it just blown our minds.

The algo did its job and cos I recently finished [Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will by Robert Sapolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determined:_A_Science_of_Life_Without_Free_Will), it spit this conversation about free will between him and his love-hate nemesis, Daniel Dennet. Watch it [here](https://youtu.be/aYzFH8xqhns?si=AyH4eAHs5cot8JYk)

Shitty weather and shittier politicians have devastated part of *Comunitat Valenciana.* All my love to the marvelous people that live in that beautiful part of the world. [heart emoji]
