Company A sucked the entire human knowledge without paying a dime to its creators, and built its wealth with it.\
Using the [knowledge distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation) technique, [Company B sucked the entire knowledge from Company A](https://www.404media.co/openai-furious-deepseek-might-have-stolen-all-the-data-openai-stole-from-us/) and didnt pay a dime to Company A.\
Company A complaint that Company B didnt pay to them.\
We all should grab a big pack of popcorn and enjoy it at least for today.

Anyway, let’s focus on one of my favourite magics in this world; **animation:**

- [A boy doing sit-ups with his dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gcktHx463E) Apparently its part of a videogame which feels even more adorable. Here is a [playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VWbFa-hNRQ) which includes **a seal cleaning the ass of a dog.**

- [Common Side Effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVHHI7B_Yuk) announced session 3, yaaaaay. Lets hope it helps bring more seasons for the astonishing [Scavengers Reign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWQH8cMpWTU) as they shared several people involved in both projects.

- Severance season 2 was announced, and they hired Oliver Latta ([extraweg](https://www.extraweg.com/)) again for [the title sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKT5bwMkOAw), so its as good as the previous one.

- [Long and detailed interview with the director of Flow](https://www.blender.org/user-stories/making-flow-an-interview-with-director-gints-zilbalodis/), Gints Zilbadolis, which includes some making-of videos worth watching. Crazy how much beauty humans can create.

Lately I was reading the [Nutrition](https://grimgrains.com/site/nutrition.html) section from **Grimgrains,** this site populated by the wizards [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html).

Out there, I visited the [Braun-Sammlung Ettel Museum für Design](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Braun-Sammlung+Ettel+Museum+f%C3%BCr+Design/@52.527291,13.3199926,13.8z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47a8510c23e4dfad:0xb07e7c91165d4d79!8m2!3d52.5241418!4d13.3363634!16s%2Fg%2F11byl684fj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Moabit. Apart from the vast collection of industrial design objects, my mind was blown by the idea behind it; just an individual collector who decided to open his studio to anyone interested in Braun products. When I visited it, I saw him having coffee in a small part of the studio with his friends while visitors were taking a look at the collection. **Looks like a cool plan for retirement times.**
