I found [this interview](https://www.noemamag.com/why-ai-is-a-philosophical-rupture/) with Tobias Rees by Nathan Gardels to be way too optimistic from my personal current AI views. Yet it has a lot of good points worth taking a look at.

> Some people say AI has “only” pattern recognition. But I think pattern recognition is actually a form of discovering the logical structure of things. Roughly, when you have a student who identifies the logical principles that underlie data and who can answer questions based on these logical principles, wouldn’t you call that understanding?

So in that sense, AI systems have a nascent sense of truth.
