        <meta name="description" content="g Commento for a while for comments (without much adoption to be honest), and while I really love the project, and the simplicity of its approach, there&amp;rsquo;s always been one unavoidable thing I never really liked too much: if you want to comment, you have to register to my commento instance.
That&amp;rsquo;s less than ideal, considering that if I did have lots of people who wanted to comment, that&amp;rsquo;d have been quite a strain on my humble home server, where my commento instance is hosted.
Today I found this post on Mastodon (feel free to follow me there by the way) by Karmanyaah Malhotra about how he reworked his website recently. I always enjoy reading about other people&amp;rsquo;s websites, so I quickly read through it, just to find out about this comment system called Cactus Comments.
Cactus Comments uses Matrix to create a federated comment section on your website. If you have a Matrix account on any instance, you can comment on Cactus! Heck you can even use a full-fledged Matrix client to do so! That&amp;rsquo;s just great.
It&amp;rsquo;s free to use and self hostable as well, so there&amp;rsquo;s really not much of an excuse not to try it out. Plus if you already have a Matrix account you&amp;rsquo;re already halfway there.
I integrated it in my Ficurinia Hugo theme without much effort, so there&amp;rsquo;s another bonus point.
And that&amp;rsquo;s it, I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about this new comment system, it&amp;rsquo;s one less service running on my home server and due to its decentralized and federated nature it will hopefully encourage more people to leave interesting comments and get a conversation going!" />
