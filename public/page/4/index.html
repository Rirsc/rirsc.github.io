                        Man pages are awesome. They genuinely are. In any *nix system you can just get documentation on your programs or even some programming things (namely a lot of C stuff, this was very useful in University) offline by just using a tiny simple command.
Of course writing man pages is a different thing. They are written in groff. I am not a fan of it, although I know people who do enjoy using it.
Markdown ❤ Pandoc Of course the obvious thing to do is write your docs in Markdown, since it&rsquo;s the best simple markup language out there. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s very easy to convert Markdown to groff, and consequently into a man page.
And of course you can just use Pandoc to do that. It&rsquo;s as simple and straight forward as you can imagine, it&rsquo;s just one command away:
pandoc --standalone --to man mymanpage.1.md -o mymanpage.1 It&rsquo;s actually not the first time I&rsquo;ve done something like this. The first was with the handy manuals I wrote for the Glorious GMMK keyboard and Model O mouse. Most of the fancy things you&rsquo;d wanna tweak with these peripherals are done with weird key combinations, and having the paper manuals or even worse PDF copies of those around isn&rsquo;t very practical. So of course I wrote man pages for those.
If you know Markdown, the syntax you have to use is of course very simple, but if you wanna do it right, you may want to know about a couple of dialect forms of Markdown:
Definition lists Definition lists are perfect for describing particular commands or arguments in your man page, and they get rendered just as you think they would in a man page. They are not part of the original Markdown spec, but Pandoc supports them no problem.
They&rsquo;re really easy to use, here&rsquo;s an example:
`-h, --help` : Shows the help message The backticks are optional but they help escaping weird characters and besides they mark a section that is effectively code.
Metadata blocks Metadata blocks are also useful to show the title of the man page. Definitely one of those small touches that you might want to have in your man page, as every proper one has them.
Again, the syntax is fairly straight forward. You want to have this at the beginning of your file and looking something like this:
% mymanual(1) Version 0.9.99 | Example manual for this blog post Example Finally I want to include an example Markdown man page I recently made for HydraPaper, so that you can get a better grasp of what a full file could look like. Of course you can also find this file in HydraPaper&rsquo;s repository if you&rsquo;re interested.
% HydraPaper(1) | General Commands Manual NAME ==== HydraPaper - Wallpaper manager with multi monitor support SYNOPSIS ======== `hydrapaper [-h] [-c WALLPAPER_PATH [WALLPAPER_PATH ...]] [-m WALLPAPER_MODES [WALLPAPER_MODES ...]] [-r] [-l]` DESCRIPTION =========== HydraPaper is a wallpaper manager, specifically designed to work around the lack of functionality of many desktop environments to set a different wallpaper for each monitor in a multi monitor setup. It accomplishes this by scaling and merging different wallpapers into a single one and setting it as spanned. It currently supports various desktop environments, including GNOME, MATE, Cinnamon and Budgie. Experimental support is included for the sway window manager. OPTIONS ======= `-h, --help` : Show the help message and exit `-c, --cli WALLPAPER_PATHS...` : Set wallpapers from the command line `-m, --modes WALLPAPER_MODES...` : Specify the modes for the wallpapers (`zoom`, `center_black`, `center_blur`, `fit_black`, `fit_blur`) `-r, --random` : Set wallpapers randomly `-l, --lockscreen` : Set lockscreen wallpapers instead of desktop ones (for supported desktop environments) BUGS ==== Bugs can be reported and filed at https://gitlab.gnome.org/gabmus/hydrapaper/issues If you are not using the flatpak version of HydraPaper, or if you are using an otherwise out of date or downstream version of it, please make sure that the bug you want to report hasn&#39;t been already fixed or otherwise caused by a downstream patch.

                        As you can see, this website is kinda different. I remade it, just because why not.
I was previously using Hexo with a nice theme called cactus (properly altered to match my preference), but at some point I got tired of that as well.
I wanted to create something simple and straight forward. This is the kind of website without too many bells and whistles. Just a blog, period.
The initial idea of static site generators kinda goes well with this concept, but I don&rsquo;t exactly know when or how things changed. Maybe people liked these tools so much they tried to make them more general purpose, or they just wanted to use them for different things. Doesn&rsquo;t matter, point is that these generators, once simple and easy ways to make a decent blog without the burden and subsequent psychological trauma of a LAMP stack, are now bloated and messy.
Well, to be fair it&rsquo;s not really an issue with the generators themselves, but with the themes. It&rsquo;s the theme that has the responsibility for how the content is meant to be laid out, what is allowed and how you should do things. Honestly calling them themes is an understatement. If the generator is the skeleton, the theme is muscles, flesh and nervous system. The so called generator is useless without one.
Making themes is one of those things that I don&rsquo;t like to do. I didn&rsquo;t like it when I was a kid playing around with Wordpress and Joomla, and I don&rsquo;t like it now. I&rsquo;d rather make a plain website instead. But that&rsquo;s not feasible for a blog because of pagination, tags, RSS feed and whatever else that doesn&rsquo;t come to mind right now.
But at some point I just said, well F it, let&rsquo;s do it. It&rsquo;s a thing I&rsquo;ll do once and basically forget it, and the gain I get from it is a website I actually like and that I can easily customize and change around whenever I feel like it.
I decided to use Hugo since it seems to be the most popular static site generator at this point in time. I&rsquo;m not new to it, and I somewhat knew my way around it (or so I thought) since I already modified another theme for the latest iteration of the Tech Pills website. After watching some YouTube tutorials and digging through the lackluster documentation what came out was a new theme I decided to call Ficurinia.
The name choice was pretty easy. This theme is inspired by the theme I was using before with Hexo called cactus. This being sort of a grittier version of cactus (if not a more personal vision on the same idea) I decided to call it after the Sicilian word for Indian fig aka prickly pear, Ficurinia.
I&rsquo;m happy to have made this theme. It&rsquo;s simple, no weird layouts or messy animations, no javascript, and it works on mobile without any modification or special rules. Heck it even looks pretty damn good in the links command line browser.
So this is my new home now. Hope you like it.

                        Alright, I started writing some unit tests for Feeds and I wanted to integrate them into meson, so that I can just run meson test or ninja test during build and have them run automagically.
As an added bonus, they should also run when creating a flatpak package, so that I don&rsquo;t accidentally push a broken built to users.
Here&rsquo;s the very simplistic way I accomplished this task:
have your tests in a tests directory in the root of your project add this to your meson.build envdata = environment() python_paths = [join_paths(meson.current_build_dir(), &#39;..&#39;)] envdata.append(&#39;PYTHONPATH&#39;, python_paths) envdata.append(&#39;TESTS_BUILDDIR&#39;, meson.current_build_dir()) test( &#39;unit-tests&#39;, import(&#39;python&#39;).find_installation(&#39;python3&#39;), args: [&#39;-m&#39;, &#39;unittest&#39;, &#39;tests&#39;], env: envdata ) While this works locally, I&rsquo;m still having problems with running them during the flatpak build in GitLab CI, so I&rsquo;ll try to solve that as well and update this post accordingly.

                        It finally happened, Feeds is now part of the World group! Here&rsquo;s the new repository! But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll keep up with the existing GitLab mirror.
This doesn&rsquo;t change too much in terms of development, but it surely makes the app more discoverable. It also provides this very nice new URL for Feeds&rsquo; website which is under gnome&rsquo;s domain name (that&rsquo;s pretty cool, uh?).
As for Feeds&rsquo; development, lately I&rsquo;ve begun a process of small cleanups here and there, and most importantly design changes.
Thanks to the help of Tobias Bernard, Alexander Mikhaylenko and some other awesome people from the libhandy community, I brought Feeds back in line with the GNOME HIG. These are small changes, but surely needed ones to have a more consistent desktop experience.
Some of the features I had planned, detailed in some of my previous posts in this blog, still haven&rsquo;t made it, tho. To be fair, some of them require a decent amount of work, and I&rsquo;d be nice if someone wanted to help with implementing them.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll try to cleanup the code more, using Glade templates where possible, splitting different classes in different files and uncluttering the logic a bit. It&rsquo;s probably one of the most boring things you could do, but if I want people to contribute, it has to happen.
That&rsquo;s it for now, stay tuned.

                        Feeds version 0.8 is coming. This release have been a little overdue, since I finally decided to change the name of the app from gnome-feeds to just gfeeds. This has to do with the use of the GNOME name, and besides even GNOME apps don&rsquo;t use the GNOME prefix in their names.
Someone criticized the name gfeeds, because it&rsquo;s kind of dumb to have GNOME/GTK app names to start with a g, similarly to how dumb it is to have KDE apps start with a k. But here&rsquo;s the catch: the g in gfeeds stands for Gabriele, I pulled a sneaky on you.
Anyway, the new name should have no problems whatsoever, and besides I learned how to transition to a new appid on Flathub.
It&rsquo;s not as seamless as you would think, but it&rsquo;s easy enough. You&rsquo;ll have to re-submit your app as if it was a new one, and specify that it&rsquo;s just an appid change. There&rsquo;s some infrastructure in place to transition from one appid to another automagically, and it involves a little extra json file in the old repo. Here you can see my PR for the new appid and the whole discussion around it. Hope it helps.
As for new stuff, let&rsquo;s see what we have:
More stability, broken feeds are automatically removed and error messages will be shown in an upcoming version (already in master). OPML file association. Now you can just open your OPMLs from your file manager and have them imported in Feeds. If you&rsquo;re offline, feeds won&rsquo;t be refreshed. Instead, an infobar will tell you that you&rsquo;re offline. Saved articles are still accessible. CPU utilization is now lower, having removed some unnecessary busy waits from the code. That&rsquo;s it for now. Again, still a lot of work to do, but little by little Feeds is coming together pretty well.
