                        Feeds version 0.6 is out with two important changes:
German translation thanks to @Etamuk Concurrent feeds refresh About the translation, I know when a project starts becoming interesting, people want to contribute. And translations are in my experience one of the indication of people really getting passionate.
I am really flattered by this contribution and it really means a lot to see this project getting some love.
Moving on to the more technical stuff, concurrent refresh or parallel refresh.
It was surprisingly easy to implement, and that really shows how important having a modular and well-thought-out code structure is.
You see, the feed download and object creation (along with the creation of all the feed items) happens asynchronously already, but adding that feed, and all of its articles to the active lists doesn&rsquo;t. There is this wonderful function GLib.idle_add(function, *args) that makes this whole process so easy and elegant. This function does no more than telling the main thread to run function(*args) whenever it can, no rush (although to a human it&rsquo;s almost instantaneous). With this method the GUI thread doesn&rsquo;t get interrupted and the UI doesn&rsquo;t freeze, but the function is still ran synchronously to it, avoiding any problems of mutual exclusion to precious variables.
# https://gitlab.com/gabmus/gnome-feeds/blob/0.6/gfeeds/feeds_manager.py#L139 class FeedsManager(metaclass=Singleton): # ... def refresh(self, *args): # ... threads_pool = [] threads_alive = [] MAX_THREADS = self.confman.conf[&#39;max_refresh_threads&#39;] for f_link in self.confman.conf[&#39;feeds&#39;]: t = threading.Thread( group = None, target = self._add_feed_async_worker, name = None, args = (f_link, True) ) threads_pool.append(t) while len(threads_pool) &gt; 0: if len(threads_alive) &lt; MAX_THREADS: t = threads_pool.pop(0) t.start() threads_alive.append(t) for i, t in enumerate(threads_alive): if not t.is_alive(): threads_alive.pop(i) while t.is_alive(): while Gtk.events_pending(): Gtk.main_iteration() This is the wonderful code that manages the parallel refresh. It&rsquo;s fairly straight forward, it keeps a pool of threads to run, and runs n of them at a time, where n is the maximum number of threads set by the user (defaults to a very mild 2).
Apart from making the refresh process faster by itself, it also reduces the impact of problems like one feed taking longer than the others to download or parse. It&rsquo;s not a likely occurrence, but if and when it happens, it doesn&rsquo;t injure the user experience too much. That&rsquo;s because the slow feed is being processed in its own thread, but the whole refresh operation doesn&rsquo;t have to wait on it.
Moving on, I wanted to lay out a roadmap of where I want Feeds to go in the future.
Read and unread articles: currently Feeds doesn&rsquo;t keep track of your actions, and if you did or didn&rsquo;t read an article. This would require some strcuture, like the serialization and deserialization of articles to a skinnier, more targeted data structure (probably something like tsv or json, but the latter is more likely) Keeping history of older articles locally: rss feeds typically don&rsquo;t contain the whole archive, mostly because the resulting file would be huge and unwieldy. But people may want to be able to re-read articles they saw some time prior. That&rsquo;s why there needs to be an option to store them up to the user&rsquo;s preference. Again, this needs serialization/deserialization as described in the bullet point above Adblocking: this speaks for itself. Modern websites are a mess, disabling JavaScript helps, but it&rsquo;s neither a soltion nor a silver bullet Saving articles: kinda like bookmarks, but not quite. Let&rsquo;s say you add this awesome blog to your feeds, and you read a super interesting article about how to make feeds refreshing concurrent with just a bunch of lines of code. You surely want to save that! I mean, it could be useful someday right? That&rsquo;s a likely usecase for me. Also, you&rsquo;d wanna keep it offline as well, just in case you need it when you&rsquo;re on a plane or something Suggestions: many online news readers give you suggestions on what to follow. It&rsquo;s an interesing feature and I&rsquo;d want to add that. People are so addicted and accustomed to social media websites that this is what they expect news consumption to be. Integration with GNOME Online Accounts: mostly to be able to sync with services like Nextcloud News. Would be a hell of a feature. And that&rsquo;s it folks. This is the list of what I&rsquo;d want to accomplish with Feeds. Not all of these features are easy, and some are prone to make the whole app slower, and that&rsquo;s one thing I 100% want to avoid.

                        My new web home Hey people. I finally got around at creating a static blog.
After using Hugo for a while, and initially deciding to try out Pelican, just to realize it&rsquo;s in a sad, outdated state right now, I settled on Hexo.
It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m crazy for JavaScript, quite the contrary. But I do realize it has its place sometimes. Using npm to install plugins is pretty clever, and besides at the end of the day I am the only one that has to use it.
It has a more complex structure compared to the aforementioned solutions, but if it gets the job done I can&rsquo;t complain too much.
Recap This is an interesting point in my life. In July I got my bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science, it was a pretty great achievement, and soon I&rsquo;ll be heading to Milan to get a master degree.
About my projects, things are going very well. I am focusing a lot on GTK/GNOME apps, probably because I&rsquo;m making things I want to use in the first place.
HydraPaper got a pretty substantial update, introducing libhandy into the mix to spice up its looks somehow, and mostly to make use of some comodity widgets it offers, namely the awesome HdyPreferencesWindow.
For the thesis of my bachelor&rsquo;s, I presented another interesting app called Unifydmin. It&rsquo;s a control center and administration panel for servers. It&rsquo;s a very interesting project, but it&rsquo;s still quite rough around the edges. I have to find the motivation to pick it up again, but right now I&rsquo;m focused on another project.
And this project is Feeds, a feed reader. It may sound dumb, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a single feed reader app for linux that I liked. Everything is either old, slow or electron based. After some time complaining about this (my girlfriend and friends can tell you about it), and basically using reddit and the podcasts I follow to get the latest news, I said F it, and made my own thing. It&rsquo;s going pretty well and the people that tried it seem to like it, and that makes me actually very proud of it.
And I think that&rsquo;s about it for now. I hope I manage to get my S together and start blogging more frequently, because I quite enjoy being able to share dev stuff online.
Let&rsquo;s see where that goes.

                        This human Hello outsider.
I’m Ricardo López Cabañero, an Industrial Design Engineer mostly focused on 3D digital and interactive works.
More about my 3D professional portfolio here.
My main interests are music (gigs), boardgames and rolegames, comix, design, films, riding my bike around forests and playing with computers to create stuff.
Contact This website This site is a digital sandbox. My ‘memex’.
Just an excuse to return to my first approach to computers when I was a teen; building sites to have fun with my friends. An overall excuse to get more into coding and writing as well as placing all my discoveries and log my projects.
Its also an excuse to force me to write more english. Please keep that in mind when you find the inmense amount of grammas errors that will spread the site.
Static website etc
No trackers, no ads. Privacy policy: not collecting or retaining any data at all.
Important info I want my webpage to be static, minimalist, energy-efficient and fast.
This website has no tracking or analytics. Based on Humans.txt, it has, of course, its own humans.txt No JavaScript Designed to last - Although I need to add a rule to show when a link is pointing outside of this site… Manual until it hurts It’s aiming to be part of the less than 1MB club Permacomputing, frugal computing, Solarpunk, artisan engineering… I am already aware of the amount of work I still have to put in here to achieve a better a more lightweight site. I will do my best. Dogmas RSS Clubs is cool This handmade club is cool too Manifest for a Humane Web Digital Ecology The Small Web is the Best Web This interview is just perfect. Anyhow, have fun. My goal is also to infest you with the idea of creating a static website. The internet is getting a bit boring lately, and there is also this Dead Internet theory, which I just hope is wrong because it sounds terribly sad.
I cant encourage you enough to start your own site now!
There are plenty of options out there, my setup is just using Hugo with the awesome theme Ficurina and deploying everything at Github.
For something like that, these tutorials are cool:
How to Build a Personal Website Using GitHub Pages and Hugo? Host on Github Pages And it was running within minutes :) If you are struggling with it, feel free to reach me. I am not an expert but I could try my best to help you. Apart from Hugo, I also tried Jekyll before.
Inspirational sites This site is a compendium of places which we could agree are considered diy places and therefore interesting. Probably at the top of my influences we could have:
100r
Wnadiarwb
Gwern
Rat Factor
Kicks Condor
javier.computer
If you need even more rabbit holes, I have collected more awesome sites in here. Heat up some coffe, put some nice music and get ready for the trip.
