This website This site is a digital sandbox.
Sometimes a blog, sometimes a wiki, maybe a ‘memex’&amp;#8599; but everytime is messy. Advanced hypertexting&amp;#8599;, I guess. Many pages are in progress, or incorrect. This is my tiny realm and its fine that way.
I want my webpage to be static, minimalist, energy-efficient and fast.

I cant encourage you enough to start your own site now. We all should be dead bored by now of looking at the same grids and feeds. Just jump in and start polinating whatever you have in mind.
There are plenty of options out there, my setup is basically using Hugo&amp;#8599; with the awesome theme Ficurina&amp;#8599; and deploying everything at Github.
For something like that, these tutorials are cool:

Inspirational sites This site is a compendium of places which we could agree are considered diy places and therefore interesting. Probably at the top of my influences, we could have:
