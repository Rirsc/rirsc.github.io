        <meta name="description" content=" entire human knowledge without paying a dime to its creators, and built its wealth with it. Company B sucked the entire knowledge from Company A&amp;#8599without paying a dime to its creators, using the knowledge distillation&amp;#8599technique. We all should grab a big pack of popcorn and enjoy it at least for today.
Anyway, let’s focus on one of my favourite magics in this world; animation:
A boy doing sit-ups with his dog&amp;#8599Apparently its part of a videogame which feels even more adorable. Here is a playthrough&amp;#8599which includes a seal cleaning the ass of the dog.
Common Side Effects&amp;#8599announced session 3, yaaaaay. Lets hope it helps bring more seasons for the astonishing Scavengers Reign&amp;#8599as they shared several people involved in both projects.
Severance season 2 was announced, and they hired Oliver Latta (extraweg&amp;#8599) again for the title sequence&amp;#8599, so its as good as the previous one.
Long and detailed interview with the director of Flow&amp;#8599, Gints Zilbadolis, which includes some making-of videos worth watching. Crazy how much beauty humans can create.
Lately I was reading the Nutrition&amp;#8599section from Grimgrains, this site populated by the wizards Hundred Rabbits&amp;#8599.
Out there, I visited the Braun-Sammlung Ettel Museum für Design&amp;#8599in Moabit. Apart from the vast collection of industrial design objects, my mind was blown by the idea behind it; just an individual collector who decided to open his studio to anyone interested in Braun products. When I visited it, I saw him having coffee in a small part of the studio with his friends while visitors were taking a look at the collection. Looks like a cool plan for retirement times.
