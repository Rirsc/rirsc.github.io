It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m crazy for JavaScript, quite the contrary. But I do realize it has its place sometimes. Using npm to install plugins is pretty clever, and besides at the end of the day I am the only one that has to use it.
It has a more complex structure compared to the aforementioned solutions, but if it gets the job done I can&amp;rsquo;t complain too much.

HydraPaper got a pretty substantial update, introducing libhandy into the mix to spice up its looks somehow, and mostly to make use of some comodity widgets it offers, namely the awesome HdyPreferencesWindow." />

<p>Hey people. I finally got around at creating a static blog.</p>
<p>After using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for a while, and initially deciding to try out <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, just to realize it&rsquo;s in a sad, outdated state right now, I settled on <a href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m crazy for JavaScript, quite the contrary. But I do realize it has its place sometimes. Using <code>npm</code> to install plugins is pretty clever, and besides at the end of the day I am the only one that has to use it.</p>
<p>It has a more complex structure compared to the aforementioned solutions, but if it gets the job done I can&rsquo;t complain too much.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>This is an interesting point in my life. In July I got my bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science, it was a pretty great achievement, and soon I&rsquo;ll be heading to Milan to get a master degree.</p>
<p>About my projects, things are going very well. I am focusing a lot on GTK/GNOME apps, probably because I&rsquo;m making things I want to use in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://gabmus.gitlab.io/HydraPaper">HydraPaper</a> got a pretty substantial update, introducing <a href="https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy">libhandy</a> into the mix to spice up its looks somehow, and mostly to make use of some comodity widgets it offers, namely the awesome <code>HdyPreferencesWindow</code>.</p>
<p>For the thesis of my bachelor&rsquo;s, I presented another interesting app called <a href="https://gitlab.com/GabMus/unifydmin">Unifydmin</a>. It&rsquo;s a control center and administration panel for servers. It&rsquo;s a very interesting project, but it&rsquo;s still quite rough around the edges. I have to find the motivation to pick it up again, but right now I&rsquo;m focused on another project.</p>
<p>And this project is <a href="https://gabmus.gitlab.io/gnome-feeds">Feeds</a>, a feed reader. It may sound dumb, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a single feed reader app for linux that I liked. Everything is either old, slow or electron based. After some time complaining about this (my girlfriend and friends can tell you about it), and basically using reddit and the podcasts I follow to get the latest news, I said F it, and made my own thing. It&rsquo;s going pretty well and the people that tried it seem to like it, and that makes me actually very proud of it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s about it for now. I hope I manage to get my S together and start blogging more frequently, because I quite enjoy being able to share dev stuff online.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see where that goes.</p>
