      <description><![CDATA[<p>I stick up heavily for Dave <a href="https://ratfactor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(ratfactor)&#8599;</a> and his profound defence on why <a href="https://ratfactor.com/tech-nope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘broligarchs’ doesnt speak for him&#8599;</a></p>
<p>These are the types of words that I save and revisit constantly. It represents my view in 99%. Full of truths and explains in detail a lot of the current tech problems. Here I selected a few quotes, but please make some time to <a href="https://ratfactor.com/tech-nope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the entire text&#8599;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Tech&rdquo;, as portrayed in the public eye right now is something I barely recognize. It’s almost universally negative: Social media, ad tech, blockchain, &lsquo;AI&rsquo;. I don’t work on any of that stuff. Am I even part of the same industry? (I don’t actually have an answer to that question.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The trans community is small and vulnerable, which is exactly why they are being targeted. Which is all the more reason attacking them or attempting to erase them from history, like our government is doing, is gutless, spineless, brainless, and heartless. <strong>The transgender computer geeks are, by volume, some of the most creative, interesting, and prolific contributors we’ve ever had.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- READ MORE! -->
<blockquote>
<p>The most visible and most rancid pieces of flesh plastered on tech’s grinning skull are the megalomaniacs behind each decision, the greedy scumbags that would turn our computers against us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These big tech bros may claim to want free markets and individual liberty but make no mistake: <strong>What they seek is the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to take every single cent of wealth from every single market on Earth and the &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; to use their enormous wealth</strong> and also the law to pull the ladder up behind them to make sure no one can ever, ever follow them up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These are the same people who want to make your car play an advertisement while you’re at a stoplight or have your TV harvest your viewing habits to sell to the highest bidder or make it impossible to own any digital goods so you have to rent them for a monthly fee forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m telling you, it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>I know it can be better because I’m living it.</p>
<p>I want everyone to have the same computer experience I have right now. I run a free operating system that serves no ads and does not update unless I explicitly tell it to. I trust the software tools I use because they are written by fellow enthusiasts. I visit ad-free websites. My computer hardware is cheap and plentiful. <strong>The computer serves me, not the other way around</strong> and I call the shots on everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Listen to a big tech billionaire talk about any subject outside of their field of business. It’s ridiculous to the point of parody. It pierces the idea that these guys are geniuses. They’re clever and utterly ruthless. They’re willing to exploit things the rest of us wouldn’t. <strong>But the idea that they’re all geniuses is a myth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My heroes don’t break or bend laws to make a buck, use their power to bully people, or think it would be cool to be feudal lords over a frightened populace of vassals. <strong>My heroes create things and share what they know and they stand up for others.</strong><br>
<br>
The broligarchs are not techie culture. They are not our leaders. They have nothing in common with us. They are vultures. They don’t speak for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, this is just a quick selection from all the gems poured into the text. Bold text on quotes are mine.</p>

<p>Someone has a problem with animated postcards. And flip-books. Or any other physical approach to bring pictures to life.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/why-ai-is-a-philosophical-rupture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this interview&#8599;</a> with Tobias Rees by Nathan Gardels to be way too optimistic from my personal current AI views. Yet it has a lot of good points worth taking a look at.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people say AI has “only” pattern recognition. But I think pattern recognition is actually a form of discovering the logical structure of things. Roughly, when you have a student who identifies the logical principles that underlie data and who can answer questions based on these logical principles, wouldn’t you call that understanding?
[…]
So in that sense, AI systems have a nascent sense of truth.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Company A sucked the entire human knowledge without paying a dime to its creators, and built its wealth with it.<br>
Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge distillation&#8599;</a> technique, <a href="https://www.404media.co/openai-furious-deepseek-might-have-stolen-all-the-data-openai-stole-from-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Company B sucked the entire knowledge from Company A&#8599;</a> and didnt pay a dime to Company A.<br>
Company A complaint that Company B didnt pay to them.<br>
We all should grab a big pack of popcorn and enjoy it at least for today.</p>
<p align="center">﹘</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s focus on one of my favourite magics in this world; <strong>animation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gcktHx463E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A boy doing sit-ups with his dog&#8599;</a> Apparently its part of a videogame which feels even more adorable. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VWbFa-hNRQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playthrough&#8599;</a> which includes <strong>a seal cleaning the ass of a dog.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVHHI7B_Yuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Common Side Effects&#8599;</a> announced session 3, yaaaaay. Lets hope it helps bring more seasons for the astonishing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWQH8cMpWTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scavengers Reign&#8599;</a> as they shared several people involved in both projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severance season 2 was announced, and they hired Oliver Latta (<a href="https://www.extraweg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extraweg&#8599;</a>) again for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKT5bwMkOAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the title sequence&#8599;</a>, so its as good as the previous one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.blender.org/user-stories/making-flow-an-interview-with-director-gints-zilbalodis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long and detailed interview with the director of Flow&#8599;</a>, Gints Zilbadolis, which includes some making-of videos worth watching. Crazy how much beauty humans can create.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">﹘</p>
<p>Lately I was reading the <a href="https://grimgrains.com/site/nutrition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nutrition&#8599;</a> section from <strong>Grimgrains,</strong> this site populated by the wizards <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hundred Rabbits&#8599;</a></p>
<p align="center">﹘</p>
<p>Out there, I visited the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Braun-Sammlung&#43;Ettel&#43;Museum&#43;f%C3%BCr&#43;Design/@52.527291,13.3199926,13.8z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47a8510c23e4dfad:0xb07e7c91165d4d79!8m2!3d52.5241418!4d13.3363634!16s%2Fg%2F11byl684fj?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braun-Sammlung Ettel Museum für Design&#8599;</a> in Moabit. Apart from the vast collection of industrial design objects, my mind was blown by the idea behind it; just an individual collector who decided to open his studio to anyone interested in Braun products. When I visited it, I saw him having coffee in a small part of the studio with his friends while visitors were taking a look at the collection. <strong>Looks like a cool plan for retirement times.</strong></p>

<p>[D] Twin Peaks is a world, and I love that world and I love that world. It&rsquo;s something that is like a magnet. It&rsquo;s to go back in there. <br>
<br>
[P] Did you have any idea when you were creating Twin Peaks how this would tap into the public Consciousness? <br>
<br>
[D] No idea. But number one thing is to do what you believe in and do it the best you can. And then um, you see how it goes in the world. I get ideas in fragments, I always say. It&rsquo;s as if in the other room, there&rsquo;s a puzzle, all the pieces are together, but in my room, they just flip one piece at a time into me and a first piece I get It&rsquo;s just a fragment of the whole puzzle, but I fall in love with this fragment. <br>
<br>
[P] Yes. Yes. <br>
<br>
[D] And I love this fragment and it holds a promise for more. And I keep it, I write it down. And then, I say that having the fragment is more bait on the  hook. And it pulls in more, and the more that come in the more faster the rest come in.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Fifty years ago, the Arecibo Message was sent—a human attempt to contact whatever might be out there, potentially listening in space. It consisted of numbers, formulas, and representations of ourselves, as well as a depiction of the telescope from which it was sent, located in Arecibo.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/arecibo-message.webp" alt="AreciboMessage" loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>I love the idea and its aesthetics—I guess because it reminds me of my beloved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game of Life&#8599;</a> It makes me wonder: would it be possible to recreate that exact drawing from one of the initial configurations?</p>
<p>From there, I did a quick search for various messages humanity has sent into space in hopes of finding life.Voyager Golden Record (1977), Cosmic Call (1999), the Teen Age Message (2008), and perhaps one of the oldest and most famous; the Pioneer Plaques. As many have pointed out, the Pioneer Plaques offered a vague representation of humanity’s cultural and racial diversity. The depiction of the woman’s body notably omits genitalia, making it feel incomplete. While searching for a more accurate or inclusive representation, somehow I ended learning about the project by <a href="https://ucsdvis159.wordpress.com/2015/02/02/joe-davis-poetica-vagina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Davis: Poetica Vagina&#8599;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1980s he came up with a project that records the vaginal contractions of ballerinas using a “vaginal detector” built in a laboratory of mechanical engineering. […] He used electronic music software in order to match the the frequency of the contractions to the English speech. He then transmitted the sounds of vaginal contractions to the nearest star systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not really sure what to think about this project at all. Lets pass to a brief musical break: <a href="https://stroomtv.bandcamp.com/album/v-jula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vèjula - Merope&#8599;</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hack&amp;Tell #100</strong> at <a href="https://c-base.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C-Base&#8599;</a> Its cool because its as informal as the past editions, just slighty longer due to some delay in the pause. They are doing some printings to whoever brings a t-shirt, so its totally understandable. At the beginning there is also a nice recap with photos from the very early editions, and some memorables moments that are shared from fixed attendes. The project that won is <a href="https://medium.com/altsoph/qr-dice-6-sided-qr-cube-c21be8f0ca11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QR-DICE: 6-side QR-cube&#8599;</a> and it just blown our minds.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>By chance, I discovered the bookshop <strong>langer blomqvist</strong>, which is full of discounted and second-hand books. I bought the gem <strong><em>Buch der Tage</em>, by Patti Smith</strong>. It consists of a daily photo with a small description covering 2018.</p>

<p><a href="https://obradinn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Return of the Obra Dinn&#8599;</a> is probably one of the best experiences I had ever have playing a videogame.

<p>Anyway, I wrote this post to mention the new game from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucas Pope&#8599;</a> the creator of the Obra.

      <title>AI image generators</title>
      <link>http://192.168.1.11:2041/posts/23/231129_ai-image-generators/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://192.168.1.11:2041/posts/23/231129_ai-image-generators/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Here comes another opinion on using or not these generators, but most importantly, on how we should take advantage of them. Nevertheless, I’m still struggling to create a solid opinion, so hopefully, this text helps position me better and clarify my thoughts.</p>
<p>First and sadly, I support the current overall rejection as <strong>the main use is focused on lazy replicating rather than creating.</strong> The widespread use of these generators is horrendous in both ethical and aesthetic terms.</p>
<p>Let’s go for the big ‘buts’.</p>
<!-- READ MORE! -->
<h2 id="the-opposite-of-beautiful-is-careless">The opposite of beautiful is careless</h2>
<p>Aesthetically, much of what is spreading is unmotivated output from quick prompting and zero filter. These are adding little to level up the scene but quite the opposite. It is also extremely sad how professional illustrators are being replaced by managers who decided to get rid of them. They wear a shiny painter’s smock with zero care for the final output (even if they are, sometimes they cannot improve what they have created so they just ease the requirements). Quite the opposite of when they had a professional who they could guide, even if sometimes this is done in an incredibly unproductive and stressful way for the person crafting the output.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the major use is a vague replication of existing styles using models that have been trained on millions of images, a lot of them from artists who didn’t allow their art for such a purpose. One could disagree, mentioning that humans are constantly supporting their art in lots of references, and it’s what the models are doing.</p>
<p>Even if I agree with it, I think <strong>it should be easy and obligatory to verify if any given image was used for training models and remove them if necessary</strong>. Similarly, it should be clearer when Siren Servers are grabbing users’ input and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C34xFEpqSqK/?igsh=MWY3Zm9uNHRta3AxdQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking for their consent.&#8599;</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, we are already seeing a swift where big companies take the majority of the credit and artists with new ideas move aside.</p>
<p>But be sad no more, humans are still awesome and get tired easily of lame repetition, and that is where all magic happens.</p>
<h2 id="human-awesomeness">Human awesomeness</h2>
<p>As humans, we get tired easily and we find this lazy outcome extremely boring in the short term. The following formula has been spread and it’s definitely how I think it should be:</p>
<p><strong>Humans + AI &gt; AI &gt; Humans</strong></p>
<p>Not only that but by just removing the human part in the process, the workflow led shortly into a vague and not appealing outcome. As clearly spotted in the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcH7fHtqGYM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video by Sabine Hossenfelder&#8599;</a> models training on their own output decrease incredibly their variety.</p>
<p>Also, as humans, we find particularly enjoyable the craftsman of things. The road is the destiny and all of that, you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Craft, craft, craft is what we want. And in a respectful way.</p>
<h2 id="its-all-about-the-output-therefore-curate-the-input">It’s all about the output, therefore curate the input</h2>
<p>In any art, the output should be the core element that holds everything. Don’t get me wrong, unleashing the story behind the work could be astounding, and sometimes is the essential of the piece (for instance, the astounding intervention by <a href="https://publicdelivery.org/gonzalez-torres-beds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Félix González-Torres: Bed Billboards&#8599;</a> always gets me goosebumps) but that should be relegated to mostly modern art conversations.</p>
<p>Perfect parallelism is still music sampling. Crop from here and there, twist as much as the waves allow you to, and make a completely new track fully distinguished from the initial point (which, from the very start point, was a solid love and curated selection from the creator).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All ideas can be atomized to unoriginal elements, it is how these elements are arranged, combined and transformed where originality is realized, and where ideas and identity become entangled—a relationship which is necessary for bringing them into reality.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://sub.davidoreilly.com/p/imitation-i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David O&rsquo;Reilly&#8599;</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t find the exact quote right now (or maybe I listened to it in a book release from him) but <a href="https://twitter.com/tyrexito?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mauro Entrialgo&#8599;</a> said something like: <strong>If you copy an artist, you are a thief. If you copy several artists, you will probably be part of an art movement. If you copy from tons and tons of artists of all types, after a while, you will have your style.</strong></p>
<p>That core mantra is how anyone should tackle any creation. Broad and curious approach to the wider amount of creation.</p>
<p>The vague use of what is provided only perpetuates the current state of human output, which is still full of racism, sexism and so on. So it’s important to never fully rely on the current systems or we will never improve further in. To that point, I quite like the thought of Yann Lecun. He observes that as a species, we are still in our infancy when it comes to utilizing these models.</p>
<p>Also, old ideas must die (similar to why immortality is a bad idea, apart from mine hehe, but that conversation is for another day).</p>
<h2 id="it-can-and-must-be-used-as-a-tool">It can and must be used as a tool</h2>
<p>As I am writing these words, I will reduce and categorise the workflows I know into these three approaches:</p>
<p><strong>1/ Use it as it is</strong> — Open <a href="https://www.krea.ai/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Krea&#8599;</a> Midjourney, or whatever app you found and start writing vague prompts. Extra points if you add established artists to the mix and perfectly canonised human styles. Obviously, this was irony; sorry but this is quite horrendous, unethical, lazy and barely adding any worthy rather than spending some time and learning the basic uses of it. This should be mostly for personal use, at most, and to get to know the apps.</p>
<p><strong>2/ Push the models</strong> — Look for new outcomes that don’t rely heavily on other’s art. Use LORA’s and/or IPA’s with your personal art for mixing ideas and arriving at new places. Be honest, visually educate yourself and discard those images that are a wrap-up from another human style. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boldtron/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boldtron&#8599;</a> approach is a good starting point as a reference. Personally, this has been my most used methodology so far. I use <a href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComfyUI&#8599;</a> with Stable Diffusion using some personal 3D renders as input and lots of trial and error.</p>

    <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.875em; margin-top: 0.5em;">Output</figcaption>
  </div>
</div>
<p><strong>3/ Train your models</strong> — There are already ‘clean’ models:<a href="https://huggingface.co/aipicasso/clean-diffusion-2-0-poc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Diffusion 2.0 PoC&#8599;</a> or <a href="https://huggingface.co/Mitsua/mitsua-diffusion-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitsua&#8599;</a>They are made of public-domain images. Go further and add your own art to the mix. Use it as a little helper. This is the most ideal scenario as well as the most technically challenged. As always, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18194394052224812/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris&#8599;</a> is doing an incredible job and it’s the perfect example of an ethical and awesome approach to the use of AI as a tool. Role Model at its best :_) My baby steps here have been merely for training using some of my hand sketches:</p>
<div class="grid-layout">
  <div class="column column-6">
    <img src="/images/posts/231129_ai_image_generators/Sketches-Training-1024x1024.webp">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.875em; margin-top: 0.5em;">Input (personal sketches)</figcaption>
    </div>
  <div class="column column-6">
    <img src="/images/posts/231129_ai_image_generators/Sketches-Training_Output.webp">
    <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.875em; margin-top: 0.5em;">Output</figcaption>
  </div>
</div>
<p>And another attempt, this time with some random 3D unused style frames I have:</p>
<div class="grid-layout">
    <div class="column column-6">
        <img src="/images/posts/231129_ai_image_generators/3D-Training-1024x1024.webp" alt="3D Training Image">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.875em; margin-top: 0.5em;">Input (personal 3D Render)</figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="column column-6">
        <img src="/images/posts/231129_ai_image_generators/3D-Training_Output.webp" alt="3D Training Output">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.875em; margin-top: 0.5em;">Output</figcaption>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Quite far away from a polished output, yet I find some of them appealing as they look from a different realm.</p>
<p>Definitely the most powerful approach as you can fine-tune and obtain exactly what you have in mind, fairly similar to any other tool.</p>
<h2 id="dont-hate-the-tech">Don’t hate the tech</h2>
<p>So yeah, with all that said, please enjoy the imagery on this site. The vast majority has been done using 3D packages, but some have been generated with the help of AI models. So far only as a personal exploration and are only spread into the LAB section of this site.</p>
