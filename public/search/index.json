always gets me goosebumps) but that should be relegated to mostly modern art conversations.\nperfect parallelism is still music sampling. crop from here and there, twist as much as the waves allow you to, and make a completely new track fully distinguished from the initial point (which, from the very start point, was a solid love and curated selection from the creator).\nall ideas can be atomized to unoriginal elements, it is how these elements are arranged, combined and transformed where originality is realized, and where ideas and identity become entangled—a relationship which is necessary for bringing them into reality.\ndavid o\u0026rsquo;reilly\u0026#8599;\ni can’t find the exact quote right now (or maybe i listened to it in a book release from him) but mauro entrialgo\u0026#8599; said something like: if you copy an artist, you are a thief. if you copy several artists, you will probably be part of an art movement. if you copy from tons and tons of artists of all types, after a while, you will have your style.\nthat core mantra is how anyone should tackle any creation. broad and curious approach to the wider amount of creation.\nthe vague use of what is provided only perpetuates the current state of human output, which is still full of racism, sexism and so on. so it’s important to never fully rely on the current systems or we will never improve further in. to that point, i quite like the thought of yann lecun. he observes that as a species, we are still in our infancy when it comes to utilizing these models.\nalso, old ideas must die (similar to why immortality is a bad idea, apart from mine hehe, but that conversation is for another day).\nit can and must be used as a tool as i am writing these words, i will reduce and categorise the workflows i know into these three approaches:\n1/ use it as it is — open krea\u0026#8599; midjourney, or whatever app you found and start writing vague prompts. extra points if you add established artists to the mix and perfectly canonised human styles. obviously, this was irony; sorry but this is quite horrendous, unethical, lazy and barely adding any worthy rather than spending some time and learning the basic uses of it. this should be mostly for personal use, at most, and to get to know the apps.\n2/ push the models — look for new outcomes that don’t rely heavily on other’s art. use lora’s and/or ipa’s with your personal art for mixing ideas and arriving at new places. be honest, visually educate yourself and discard those images that are a wrap-up from another human style. boldtron\u0026#8599; approach is a good starting point as a reference. personally, this has been my most used methodology so far. i use comfyui\u0026#8599; with stable diffusion using some personal 3d renders as input and lots of trial and error.\ninput (personal 3d renders)\routput\r3/ train your models — there are already ‘clean’ models:clean diffusion 2.0 poc\u0026#8599; or mitsua\u0026#8599;they are made of public-domain images. go further and add your own art to the mix. use it as a little helper. this is the most ideal scenario as well as the most technically challenged. as always, chris\u0026#8599; is doing an incredible job and it’s the perfect example of an ethical and awesome approach to the use of ai as a tool. role model at its best :_) my baby steps here have been merely for training using some of my hand sketches:\ninput (personal sketches)\routput\rand another attempt, this time with some random 3d unused style frames i have:\ninput (personal 3d render)\routput\rquite far away from a polished output, yet i find some of them appealing as they look from a different realm.\ndefinitely the most powerful approach as you can fine-tune and obtain exactly what you have in mind, fairly similar to any other tool.\ndon’t hate the tech so yeah, with all that said, please enjoy the imagery on this site. the vast majority has been done using 3d packages, but some have been generated with the help of ai models. so far only as a personal exploration and are only spread into the lab section of this site.\n","title":"AI image generators"},{"date":"2023-08-21","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"http://192.168.178.34:1313/posts/21/210821_zinefest-at-subaermarkt/","summary":"I visited for the first time this sweet fest at Subaemarkt where artists and illustrators show and sell their gems.\nThis is my loot;
