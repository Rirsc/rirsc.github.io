there.\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s got a big problem: it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a hassle, and you have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. there\u0026rsquo;s a wide ecosystem of plugins that integrate into each other, most of them requiring custom configuration code to work. it took a while, but i managed to put together a pretty good config.\nover time this config, that was initially living in my dotfiles repo, grew larger and more complex. so came the refactorings, then the generalizations, modularization, custom settings systems\u0026hellip;\nit outgrew its role as a humble user config, it became its own thing. at some point i had to give it its own repo, and along with it, a proper name: nvpunk.\nyeah, that sounds about right.\nromantic storytelling aside, let me tell you what nvpunk is: a complete, out of the box and ready to go neovim distribution.\nin other words, it\u0026rsquo;s a fully featured neovim configuration you can use without having to learn how to select, install and manage plugins, and maintain the configuration glue that holds it all together.\nsome highlights of what\u0026rsquo;s included:\nlsp support with completions, snippets, diagnostics and formatting dap support for debugging with a familiar ui advanced syntax highlighting with treesitter interactive file tree with git support code outline panel fancy greeter with customizable header graphics theme chooser with a selection of popular preconfigured themes categorized right click menu to access some useful features i\u0026rsquo;ve been heavily inspired by other projects like lunarvim, nvchad and astronvim, with the difference that nvpunk tries to offer a ready to go experience, while these distros give you more of a base to build on yourself, still requiring manual configuration to be effective.\nnvpunk still offers some degree of custom configuration, but it\u0026rsquo;s more tailored towards advanced users that know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, and it\u0026rsquo;s very much optional.\nmost of the things you may want to change are configurable via a ui preferences menu, accessible from the greeter.\ni understand that nvpunk may not be for everyone: some may call it bloated, and typically (neo)vim fans like to roll their own config anyway (just like i did), but that\u0026rsquo;s fine. nvpunk is mostly targeted at people that are looking for a good, feature-rich text editor, but that don\u0026rsquo;t have the time, interest or knowledge to maintain their own config.\nyou can find out more on nvpunk\u0026rsquo;s website and on the gitlab repository.\n","title":"Nvpunk: A Modern Neovim Distribution with Batteries Included"},{"date":"2019-08-11","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/pages/about/","summary":"This human

to be part of the less than 1mb club permacomputing, frugal computing, solarpunk, artisan engineering… i am already aware of the amount of work i still have to put in here to achieve a better a more lightweight site. i will do my best. dogmas rss clubs is cool this handmade club is cool too manifest for a humane web digital ecology the small web is the best web this interview is just perfect. anyhow, have fun. my goal is also to infest you with the idea of creating a static website. the internet is getting a bit boring lately, and there is also this dead internet theory, which i just hope is wrong because it sounds terribly sad.\ni cant encourage you enough to start your own site now!\nthere are plenty of options out there, my setup is just using hugo with the awesome theme ficurina and deploying everything at github.\nfor something like that, these tutorials are cool:\nhow to build a personal website using github pages and hugo? host on github pages and it was running within
