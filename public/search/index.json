Let’s go for the big ‘buts’.\nThe opposite of beautiful is careless Aesthetically, much of what is spreading is unmotivated output from quick prompting and zero filter. These are adding little to level up the scene but quite the opposite. It is also extremely sad how professional illustrators are being replaced by managers who decided to get rid of them. They wear a shiny painter’s smock with zero care for the final output (even if they are, sometimes they cannot improve what they have created so they just ease the requirements). Quite the opposite of when they had a professional who they could guide, even if sometimes this is done in an incredibly unproductive and stressful way for the person crafting the output.\nNowadays, the major use is a vague replication of existing styles using models that have been trained on millions of images, a lot of them from artists who didn’t allow their art for such a purpose. One could disagree, mentioning that humans are constantly supporting their art in lots of references, and it’s what the models are doing.\nEven if I agree with it, I think it should be easy and obligatory to verify if any given image was used for training models and remove them if necessary.

sorry but this is quite horrendous, unethical, lazy and barely adding any worthy rather than spending some time and learning the basic uses of it. this should be mostly for personal use, at most, and to get to know the apps.\n2/ push the models — look for new outcomes that don’t rely heavily on other’s art. use lora’s and/or ipa’s with your personal art for mixing ideas and arriving at new places. be honest, visually educate yourself and discard those images that are a wrap-up from another human style. boldtron\u0026#8599\rapproach is a good starting point as a reference. personally, this has been my most used methodology so far. i use comfyui\u0026#8599\rwith stable diffusion using some personal 3d renders as input and lots of trial and error.\ninput (personal 3d renders) output 3/ train your models — there are already ‘clean’ models\u0026#8599\r. they are made of public-domain images. go further and add your own art to the mix. use it as a little helper. this is the most ideal scenario as well as the most technically challenged. as always, chris\u0026#8599\ris doing an incredible job and it’s the perfect example of an ethical and awesome approach to the use of ai as a tool. role model at its best :_). my baby steps here have been merely for training using some of my hand sketches:\ninput (personal sketches) output and another attempt, this time with some random 3d unused style frames i have:\ninput (personal 3d render) output quite far away from a polished output, yet i find some of them appealing as they look from a different realm.\ndefinitely the most powerful approach as you can fine-tune and obtain exactly what you have in mind, fairly similar to any other tool.\ndon’t hate the tech so yeah, with all that said, please enjoy the imagery on this site. the vast majority has been done using 3d packages, but some have been generated with the help of ai models. so far only as a personal exploration and are only spread into the lab section of this site.\n","title":"AI image generators"},{"date":"2023-02-07","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"http://192.168.178.34:1313/posts/230207_continue-the-struggle/","summary":"Just a blooper from a quick thing for testing the Blender-Unity workflow without exporting to .fbx.
