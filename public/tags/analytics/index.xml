      <description><![CDATA[<p>This blog is fairly new, and so I still have to set up everything. Comments are obviously a very important part of a blog, especially if you want any kind of feedback on the stuff you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>The lazy solution is pretty obvious: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus#Criticism,_privacy,_and_security_concerns"><em>Disqus</em> the privacy nightmare</a>.</p>
<p>I like the wild idea of respecting my readers&rsquo; privacy, and so I started looking for alternative solutions.</p>
<p>The one solution I chose to adopt is an open source comment platform called <a href="https://commento.io/"><strong>Commento</strong></a>. It works just like Disqus, except since it doesn&rsquo;t make money from violating people&rsquo;s privacy, you can&rsquo;t really use it for free.</p>
<p>You can either choose to pay what you want for it (with a minimum of 3 USD) or host it yourself.</p>
<p>I already pay for a VPS for <a href="https://techpills.technology">Tech Pills&rsquo; website</a>, but it&rsquo;s not subject to heavy load, so a service more running on it wouldn&rsquo;t really hurt.</p>
<p>You can install Commento using <code>docker-compose</code>, which is very convenient. I made some changes to the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to better suit my needs, and put an nginx reverse proxy in front of it to add https into the mix.</p>
<p>After writing some CSS to adapt it to the blog&rsquo;s theme, the new comment box is ready to roll.</p>
<p>As a nice (unexpected) bonus, Commento also provides some basic analytics like total page views and number of comments. And that&rsquo;s all totally anonymous, it&rsquo;s just a faceless number that&rsquo;s not associated to any identity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about it, if you&rsquo;re looking for a privacy respecting, open source, powerful comment platform, that&rsquo;s also pretty easy to install and offers some bonus analytics on top, Commento is the way to go.</p>
