<p>[D] Twin Peaks is a world, and I love that world and I love that world. It&rsquo;s something that is like a magnet. It&rsquo;s to go back in there. <br>
<br>
[P] Did you have any idea when you were creating Twin Peaks how this would tap into the public Consciousness? <br>
<br>
[D] No idea. But number one thing is to do what you believe in and do it the best you can. And then um, you see how it goes in the world. I get ideas in fragments, I always say. It&rsquo;s as if in the other room, there&rsquo;s a puzzle, all the pieces are together, but in my room, they just flip one piece at a time into me and a first piece I get It&rsquo;s just a fragment of the whole puzzle, but I fall in love with this fragment. <br>
<br>
[P] Yes. Yes. <br>
<br>
[D] And I love this fragment and it holds a promise for more. And I keep it, I write it down. And then, I say that having the fragment is more bait on the  hook. And it pulls in more, and the more that come in the more faster the rest come in.
