      <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a quite avid reddit user. Like it or not, reddit is a very central place where communities for stuff that I care about tend to aggregate.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I have felt the need for a reddit app on my Linux desktop, and I waited and kept waiting for one that would finally allow me to break free of using the web version.</p>
<p>Some honorable mentions are due to projects like the now seemingly abandoned <a href="https://github.com/samdroid-apps/something-for-reddit">Something for reddit</a> and the terminal app <a href="https://gitlab.com/ajak/tuir/">Tuir</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they were not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>At some point I just decided to start scratching this itch of mine, and so my quest began.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_Linux/screenshot.avif" alt="Screenshot of Giara"></p>
<p>And this is how Giara got to be!</p>
<p>At this current stage Giara is already usable, with most of the main features you&rsquo;d expect from a reddit app to work.</p>

<p>Many people, including some familiar faces, stepped up and helped me in the development process, and I have already received some contributions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100% done, tho. It still needs to reach feature parity with the reddit web client, as features like awards, polls, galleries and private messages are still to be implemented. I&rsquo;m also working on improving performance, as the app tends to be slower than I would prefer sometimes. All of these missing features and improvements are up next in my to-do list.</p>
<p>The app has also been recently moved to the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World">World group in GNOME&rsquo;s GitLab</a>, and I&rsquo;m incredibly happy for it! The next step now is to add support for the <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/"><em>Damned Lies</em></a> translation platform, so that it can be even easier to contribute new translations to the project.</p>
<p>As always any help and contribution is highly appreciated!</p>
<p>You can find the repo on <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/giara">GNOME&rsquo;s GitLab</a> and you can download the latest stable version of Giara from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.giara">Flathub</a>. You may also want to take a look at <a href="https://giara.gabmus.org">Giara&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
