C-Base&#8599</a>
 





 Its cool because its as informal as the past editions, just slighty longer due to some delay in the pause. They are doing some printings to whoever brings a t-shirt, so its totally understandable. At the beginning there is also a nice recap with photos from the very early editions, and some memorables moments that are shared from fixed attendes. The project that won is <a href="https://medium.com/altsoph/qr-dice-6-sided-qr-cube-c21be8f0ca11"

 target="_blank" rel="noopener" >



Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will by Robert Sapolsky&#8599</a>
 





 and this conversation about free will between Robert and his love-hate nemesis, Daniel Dennet, appeared on my feed. Watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/aYzFH8xqhns?si=AyH4eAHs5cot8JYk"

<p>I have been playing the latest album from <strong>Shellac, To All Trains</strong> (snif, DEP Steve Albini) in order to keep his memory a bit more recent in my brain these days.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We went to the exposition <strong>Sound System Culture</strong> at Bethanien. Saw a noisy performance which almost destroyed our ears, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>Entered the rabbit hole of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Seim"

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I discovered and read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox"
 target="_blank" rel="noopener" >



Moravec&rsquo;s paradox&#8599</a>
 





 It put words into something that I learn while studiying character animation; basic human locomotive is extremely expensive and difficult to compute. I still dont get why we are triying to replicate our movements and lookalikes.</p>
<p>Just fall in love with <strong>John Wilson</strong> again as Im going trought the second season of his masterpiece ‘How to with John Wilson’. Btw, apart from his <a href="https://vimeo.com/johnsmovies"
 target="_blank" rel="noopener" >



official vimeo&#8599</a>
 





 he also has this other account with even more content in case you need it: <a href="https://vimeo.com/datejohn"
 target="_blank" rel="noopener" >



DATES&#8599</a>
 





</p>
<p>Catching up with <a href="https://jessemoynihan.com/"
 target="_blank" rel="noopener" >



Forming&#8599</a>
 





 by <strong>Jesse Moynihan</strong>. I cant wait to be finished and collected in a sweet printed edition. I mean, reading it on a screen is ok, but cant compete with a proper edition of it to grab whenever I need to be amazed with its colors, characters and story overall.</p>
