      <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a quite avid reddit user. Like it or not, reddit is a very central place where communities for stuff that I care about tend to aggregate.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I have felt the need for a reddit app on my Linux desktop, and I waited and kept waiting for one that would finally allow me to break free of using the web version.</p>
<p>Some honorable mentions are due to projects like the now seemingly abandoned <a href="https://github.com/samdroid-apps/something-for-reddit">Something for reddit</a> and the terminal app <a href="https://gitlab.com/ajak/tuir/">Tuir</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they were not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>At some point I just decided to start scratching this itch of mine, and so my quest began.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_Linux/screenshot.avif" alt="Screenshot of Giara"></p>
<p>And this is how Giara got to be!</p>
<p>At this current stage Giara is already usable, with most of the main features you&rsquo;d expect from a reddit app to work.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Giara_is_a_reddit_app_for_Linux/screenshot2.avif" alt="Screenshot of a comment tree"></p>
<p>Many people, including some familiar faces, stepped up and helped me in the development process, and I have already received some contributions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100% done, tho. It still needs to reach feature parity with the reddit web client, as features like awards, polls, galleries and private messages are still to be implemented. I&rsquo;m also working on improving performance, as the app tends to be slower than I would prefer sometimes. All of these missing features and improvements are up next in my to-do list.</p>
<p>The app has also been recently moved to the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World">World group in GNOME&rsquo;s GitLab</a>, and I&rsquo;m incredibly happy for it! The next step now is to add support for the <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/"><em>Damned Lies</em></a> translation platform, so that it can be even easier to contribute new translations to the project.</p>
<p>As always any help and contribution is highly appreciated!</p>
<p>You can find the repo on <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/giara">GNOME&rsquo;s GitLab</a> and you can download the latest stable version of Giara from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.giara">Flathub</a>. You may also want to take a look at <a href="https://giara.gabmus.org">Giara&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>

      <title>Feeds moved to World and design overhaul</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/feeds-moved-to-world-and-design-overhaul/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It finally happened, Feeds is now part of the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World">World</a> group! <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gfeeds">Here&rsquo;s the new repository</a>! But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll keep up with the existing GitLab mirror.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t change too much in terms of development, but it surely makes the app more discoverable. It also provides <a href="https://world.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gfeeds/">this very nice new URL for Feeds&rsquo; website</a> which is under gnome&rsquo;s domain name (that&rsquo;s pretty cool, uh?).</p>
<p>As for Feeds&rsquo; development, lately I&rsquo;ve begun a process of small cleanups here and there, and most importantly design changes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/post_pics/Feeds-moved-to-World-and-design-overhaul/feeds-next-window.avif" alt="Feeds&rsquo; new UI"></p>
<p>Thanks to the help of <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/bertob">Tobias Bernard</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/exalm">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> and some other awesome people from the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!nrNOrVsRZxzaDdspgs:talk.puri.sm?via=talk.puri.sm&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=librem.one">libhandy community</a>, I brought Feeds back in line with the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/">GNOME HIG</a>. These are small changes, but surely needed ones to have a more consistent desktop experience.</p>
<p>Some of the features I had planned, detailed in some of my previous posts in this blog, still haven&rsquo;t made it, tho. To be fair, some of them require a decent amount of work, and I&rsquo;d be nice if someone wanted to help with implementing them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll try to cleanup the code more, using Glade templates where possible, splitting different classes in different files and uncluttering the logic a bit. It&rsquo;s probably one of the most boring things you could do, but if I want people to contribute, it has to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, stay tuned.</p>
